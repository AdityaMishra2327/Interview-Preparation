 Hashing: Key Concepts and Techniques

Hashing is a technique used to convert an input of variable size into a fixed-size value, known as a hash value, using mathematical functions. Hashing is widely employed in data storage and retrieval systems to enable fast access to data.

# Key Concepts

1. Hash Function: A mathematical formula that transforms input data into a fixed-size hash value. 
2. Hash Table: A data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is a hash value, and the corresponding value is the actual data, enabling quick data retrieval.
3. Collision: Occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value, leading to the need for collision resolution techniques. Learn more about the Separate Chaining collision handling technique [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/separate-chaining-collision-handling-technique-in-hashing/).

# Types of Hash Functions

1. Division Method: Divides the input by a constant and uses the remainder as the hash value. This is a simple and widely used method.
2. Mid Square Method: Squares the input and extracts the middle digits to form the hash value. This method reduces clustering of values.
3. Folding Method: Breaks the input into equal-sized sections, then adds them together to obtain the hash value.
4. Multiplication Method: Multiplies the input by a constant and uses the fractional part of the result as the hash value. This method is less prone to clustering.

# Collision Resolution Techniques

1. Separate Chaining (Open Hashing): When a collision occurs, all elements with the same hash value are stored in a linked list at the hash index. Read more about this technique [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/separate-chaining-collision-handling-technique-in-hashing/).
2. Open Addressing (Closed Hashing): When a collision occurs, alternative locations within the hash table are searched based on specific strategies until an empty slot is found. Open addressing methods include:
   - Linear Probing: Sequentially searches for the next available slot.
   - Quadratic Probing: Uses quadratic intervals to find an open slot, reducing clustering.
   - Double Hashing: Applies a second hash function to the key to determine the interval for finding a new position.

# Applications of Hashing

- Data Storage and Retrieval: Hashing is used in databases and file systems for efficient storage and quick retrieval of data.
- Password and Digital Signature Verification: Hashing verifies data authenticity and integrity.
- Load Balancing: Hashing helps distribute network requests evenly across multiple servers.
- Data Integrity and Authentication: Secure hashing algorithms, such as SHA and MD5, generate hash values that protect data from tampering.
