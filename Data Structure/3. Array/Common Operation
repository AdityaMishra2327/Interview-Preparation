 Common Operations on Arrays:

1. Accessing Elements:
   - Time complexity: O(1)
   - Example: `arr[2]` accesses the third element of the array.

2. Updating Elements:
   - Time complexity: O(1)
   - Example: `arr[1] = 10;` updates the second element.

3. Searching Elements:
   - Linear Search: Searches each element one by one.
     - Time complexity: O(n)
     - Example: Find if 5 exists in `arr = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}`.
   - Binary Search: Efficient search for sorted arrays.
     - Time complexity: O(log n)

4. Insertion:
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Inserting at a specific index involves shifting elements.
   
5. Deletion:
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Removing an element also requires shifting subsequent elements.
