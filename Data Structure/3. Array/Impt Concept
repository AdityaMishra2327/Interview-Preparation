 Important Array Concepts for MAANG Interviews:

# 1. Two-pointer Technique:
   - Useful for problems like finding pairs that sum to a target, sorting, or removing duplicates.
   - Example Problems:
     - Pair with target sum: Given a sorted array, find two numbers that sum to a target.
     - Merge two sorted arrays: Merge two arrays without using extra space.

# 2. Sliding Window Technique:
   - Efficient for finding subarrays with specific properties (e.g., sum, maximum).
   - Example Problems:
     - Maximum sum of subarray of size k: Find the subarray with the maximum sum of size k.

# 3. Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm:
   - Used for finding the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time.
   - Example Problem:
     - Maximum Subarray: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

# 4. Dynamic Array (Resizable Array):
   - Example: In languages like Python, lists or dynamic arrays automatically adjust size.
   - More flexible but may involve amortized O(1) insertion.

# 5. Matrix Manipulation:
   - Multi-dimensional arrays are frequently used in questions involving matrices (e.g., matrix rotation, traversal).
   - Example Problems:
     - Rotate matrix by 90 degrees
     - Spiral order matrix traversal
