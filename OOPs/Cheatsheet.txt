Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications.
OR
In Easier words, "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a way of structuring your code to make it more organized, reusable, and easier to understand. It’s based on the concept of "classes" and "objects"."

The main concept of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

The core OOP principles—classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

- Class :
A class is a collection of objects. 
A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. 
It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 

Some points on Python class:  
-Classes are created by keyword "class".
- Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

Syntax :
```
class ClassName:
    #statements

- Objects : 
An instance of a class, with its own specific data and behavior based on the class.
It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, pen etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.

An Object consists of :
- State -> Attributes/Properties of the object --> Age, Color of the Dog(Example)
- Behaviour -> Methods/Response of the object --> Eating or Sleeping(Example)
- Identity -> Unique Name & enables to interact objects --> Name of the dog(Example)

Syntax:
obj = Dog() #Dog is the class

-The Python self :
*This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.
Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
It represents the instance of the class, allowing you to access the instance's attributes and methods. Every time you create an object from a class and call one of its methods, Python automatically passes the object as the first argument to the method – this argument is typically called self.

The Python __init__ Method 
The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

FOUR PILLAR OF OOPS:
1. Python Inheritance :
- It is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 
- Derived/Child Class -> class that derives properties.
- Base/Parent Class -> class from which properties being derived.
- Shows real-world relationship well.
- Provides code Reusability.
- Allow to add more & more features without modifying it.
- Transitive in Nature if B derived from A thnn all the subclasses from B would automatically inherit from A.

Types of Inheritance :-
- Single Inheritance: Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.
- Multilevel Inheritance: Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class. 
- Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical-level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.
- Multiple Inheritance: Multiple-level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.

Example : 
```
# Python code to demonstrate how parent constructors
# are called.

# parent class
class Person(object):

    # __init__ is known as the constructor
    def __init__(self, name, idnumber):
        self.name = name
        self.idnumber = idnumber

    def display(self):
        print(self.name)
        print(self.idnumber)
        
    def details(self):
        print("My name is {}".format(self.name))
        print("IdNumber: {}".format(self.idnumber))
    
# child class
class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, idnumber, salary, post):
        self.salary = salary
        self.post = post

        # invoking the __init__ of the parent class
        Person.__init__(self, name, idnumber)
        
    def details(self):
        print("My name is {}".format(self.name))
        print("IdNumber: {}".format(self.idnumber))
        print("Post: {}".format(self.post))


# creation of an object variable or an instance
a = Employee('Rahul', 886012, 200000, "Intern")

# calling a function of the class Person using
# its instance
a.display()
a.details()
```

2. Python Polymorphism :
- It simply means having many forms.
- In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. 
- The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.

Example : len() function in python
as len("greeks") and len([45,34,23,33])

OR

def add(x, y, z = 0): 
    return x + y+z

# Driver code 
print(add(2, 3))
print(add(2, 3, 4))

[IMPORTANT!!]

Abstract base classes (ABCs) define a common interface for a group of subclasses. They cannot be instantiated themselves and require subclasses to provide implementations for their abstract methods. ABCs ensure that derived classes adhere to a specific protocol, thus supporting polymorphism.


Example:
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.sound())
# Output:
# Bark
# Meow
```

-What is method overriding in polymorphism?
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize or completely replace the behavior of the method inherited from the superclass.

Example:
```
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.sound())  # Output: "Bark"
```

- METHOD OVERLOADING :
Method Overloading in Python means creating methods with the same name but different parameters. Although Python doesn’t support it natively, you can simulate it using:

1. Default Parameters: Provide default values for parameters.
2. `*args` and `kwargs`: Allow methods to handle a variable number of arguments.
3. Conditional Logic: Use conditions to handle different argument types or counts within the same method.

Example with `*args`:
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, *args):
        return sum(args)

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(2, 3))      # Output: 5
print(calc.add(2, 3, 4))   # Output: 9
```

This flexibility lets Python mimic method overloading by handling various argument configurations in a single method.

- What is __init__ in Python?
__init__ is a special method (constructor) in Python classes. It’s automatically called when a new instance (object) of the class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes or perform any setup required for the object.

- What is super() in Python?
super() is used to call methods of a superclass (parent class) from a subclass (child class). It returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to the superclass. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a subclass.


class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        super().__init__(arg1)  # Calls the __init__() method of the ParentClass
        self.arg2 = arg2

- Why is self used in Python?
'self' is a convention in Python used to refer to the instance of a class (object) itself. It’s the first parameter of instance methods and refers to the object calling the method. It allows methods to access and manipulate attributes (variables) that belong to the instance.


class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, {self.name}!"

obj = MyClass("Alice")
print(obj.greet())  # Output: Hello, Alice!

3. Python Encapsulation :
- It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
- This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
- To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
- It encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.

Example :
```
# Python program to
# demonstrate private members
# "__" double underscore represents private attribute. 
# Private attributes start with "__".

# Creating a Base class
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = "GeeksforGeeks"
        self.__c = "GeeksforGeeks" 

# Creating a derived class
class Derived(Base):
    def __init__(self):

        # Calling constructor of
        # Base class
        Base.__init__(self)
        print("Calling private member of base class: ")
        print(self.__c)


# Driver code
obj1 = Base()
print(obj1.a)

# Uncommenting print(obj1.c) will
# raise an AttributeError

# Uncommenting obj2 = Derived() will
# also raise an AtrributeError as
# private member of base class
# is called inside derived class
```

4. Data Abstraction :
- It hides unnecessary code details from the user. 
- When we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.

Example :
```
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.__length = length  # Private attribute
        self.__width = width    # Private attribute

    def area(self):
        return self.__length * self.__width

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.__length + self.__width)


rect = Rectangle(5, 3)
print(f"Area: {rect.area()}")          # Output: Area: 15
print(f"Perimeter: {rect.perimeter()}")  # Output: Perimeter: 16

# print(rect.__length)  # This will raise an AttributeError as length and width are private attributes
```

What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
Answer: Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The appropriate method is determined at compile time based on the method signature. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The decision on which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual object type.

What are abstract classes?
Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain one or more abstract methods. Abstract methods are declared without implementation and must be implemented by subclasses.

What is an interface?
Answer: An interface is a blueprint that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It provides a way to achieve multiple inheritance in languages that do not support it directly.

What is the "this" keyword?
Answer: The "this" keyword refers to the current object instance within a class. It is used to access instance variables or call instance methods of the class.

What is the "super" keyword?
Answer: The "super" keyword is used to call the superclass's constructor or refer to the superclass's methods or variables from a subclass.

What is method hiding?
Answer: Method hiding occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same name and signature as a static method in the superclass. The subclass's method hides the superclass's method, and the method invoked depends on the reference type rather than the object type.

What are access modifiers, and what are their purposes?
Answer: Access modifiers define the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes, methods, constructors). The main access modifiers are public, private, protected, and package-private/default. They control how members can be accessed from other classes and packages.

Explain the "final" keyword.
Answer: In OOP, the "final" keyword can be applied to a class, method, or variable. A final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable cannot be reassigned once initialized.

What is a constructor?
Answer: A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state and perform setup tasks.

What is a destructor?
Answer: A destructor is a special method that is called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. It is used to release resources and perform cleanup operations.

Explain the concept of static members
Answer: Static members (attributes or methods) belong to the class rather than individual objects. They are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name.

What is the "instanceof" operator used for?
Answer: The "instanceof" operato is used to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class or implements a specific interface. It checks the object's type at runtime and returns a boolean value indicating whether the object is an instance of the specified class or interface.

What is a constructor chaining?
Answer: Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class or between base and derived classes. It allows constructors to reuse code and perform common initialization tasks.

What is the difference between composition and inheritance?
Answer: Composition represents a "has-a" relationship, where a class contains objects of other classes as its members. Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass.

What is method visibility, and how is it controlled?
Answer: Method visibility refers to the accessibility of methods from other classes. It is controlled by access modifiers like "public," "private","protected," and "package-private/default."

Explain the concept of dynamic method dispatch.
Answer: Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism that enables a method call on an object to be resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the object, rather than the reference type.

What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
Answer: Shallow copy creates a new object but copies only the references of the original object's members. Deep copy, on the other hand, creates a new object and copies all the content, including recursively copying nested objects, if any.

What are virtual functions (or virtual methods)?
Answer: Virtual functions allow late binding or runtime polymorphism, enabling a subclass to provide its implementation for a method declared in a base class.

What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?
Answer: The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. Subclasses must maintain the behavior expected by the superclass.
